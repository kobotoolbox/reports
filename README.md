# Reports

We want to make it easy to deliver dynamic reports using R. There are two different approaches we could take:

1.  We could build a web application that allows a user to compile various reports.
2.  We can manually compile reports and distribute them manually.

Realtime reporting (1) has a great ring, but can be quite difficult. To make things easy, I have taken a quick pass at (2) using a Makefile and R's knitr package.
